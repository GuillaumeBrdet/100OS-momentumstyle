  # Fix RLS policies for tasks table

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies
    - Create public policies that work without authentication
    - Allow access based on user_id stored in the row itself
    
  2. Security
    - Users can only access tasks matching their browser's user_id
    - No authentication required (browser extension use case)
